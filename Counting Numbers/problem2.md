# Input:
The program will be given an unspecified number of datasets. Each dataset consists of three space-separated parts: the target integer, the length of the sequence to be searched, and the sequence itself. The individual numbers in the sequence are also space-separated; the datasets are separated from each other by a newline character.

# Output:
The output should be a sequence of numbers where the i-th element is equal to the number of occurrences of the number given in the first part of the i-th dataset read from the input in the sequence that is the third part of that dataset. The individual elements of this sequence should be separated by a newline character.

## Examples of Input:
