Jaś's name day is the day after tomorrow. Like for any young boy, it's a very special day in his life. He will surely receive plenty of gifts, sweets, and other delicious treats. However, Jaś goes to school, and his name day falls on a regular school day, so he must attend. The worst part is not that he has to go to school instead of celebrating all day and indulging in the treats prepared by his mother. The worst part is that, like every other boy in school, Jaś has to give out candies to his classmates during one of the lessons. This is a task that Jaś absolutely dislikes. However, he can't avoid it – it's a tradition, and he doesn't want to lie to his mother by saying he distributed the candies when he didn't. Besides, it would be embarrassing in front of the entire class – having a name day without candies – no, no, that's absolutely out of the question.

His mother has already bought the right amount of candies. Since distributing them is so important, she placed the candies next to Jaś's school bag in his room today to make sure he doesn't forget them. Meanwhile, he can't sleep because of it. The candies, with their scent reminding him of their presence, bring back terrible memories of last year's name day and the candies in class, when, in front of the entire giggling class, he had to kiss the teacher...

Jaś decided to chase away the bad thoughts by killing some time. He took the bag of candies and decided to count them. He quickly finished counting, and the bad thoughts came back. So, he decided he needed to know whether there would be candies left for him this year, like last year, or if his mother calculated it better this time. Jaś knew how many people were in his class and knew that he couldn't favor anyone – everyone had to get the same number of candies, except for himself, since he doesn't eat them at school. He was a good friend and wanted to give as many as possible to each classmate. However, if he couldn't distribute all the candies evenly, Jaś would take the leftover ones home and eat them himself.

The calculation of whether any candies would be left was too difficult for him, a poor little boy. So, he asked you for help. Knowing how many people are in Jaś's class and how many candies his mother bought, calculate whether there will be any candies left for him after distributing them among his classmates.

### Input
The first line of input contains an integer \( D \) (1 ≤ \( D \) ≤ 500), representing the number of data sets. Each data set consists of two integers \( L \) and \( C \) (1 ≤ \( L \), \( C \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)), representing the number of people in Jaś's class and the number of candies his mother bought, respectively.

### Output
For each data set, output "YES" if there are any candies left for Jaś, or "NO" if he distributes all the candies.

### Example
**Input:**

```
2
3 2
55 22
```

**Output:**

```
NO
YES
```
