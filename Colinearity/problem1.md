# Problem: COLLINEARITY OF POINTS
Task:
Determine whether the given 3 points are collinear or not.

## Input:
First, the number of test cases t (1 < t â‰¤ 100) is given. In each subsequent line, the coordinates of three points are given as integers in the range [-1000, 1000]. The consecutive coordinates are separated by a tab.

## Output:
The output should be the word YES if the given three points are collinear, or the word NO if they are not collinear. Each answer is written on a separate line.
